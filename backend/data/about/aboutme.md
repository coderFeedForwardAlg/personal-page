I dont know Go, C++ or C but I am willing to learn any new Programing languege.

I want to work at a startup insted of a big compnay becaue I want to work at a place where I can have a big impact and not be changing a pixle in the corrner of a screen that knowbody looks at, at some big tech company.


I am goel driven and extreamly reziliant/presistant.

I am risk orianted in work and in life. I find that risks are often worth it. By deffinition risks dont work out most of the time. but the cost of taking a risk and it failing is almost always much smaller than you think, and the pay off of it working is almost always much bigger than you think.

after college I started my own startup with my roomate from college who was a chemist. The idea was to run servers using biofuel to reduct the cost of cloud infrestructer and AI infrence. The chemist handeled making electricity from biofuel and I perchised retiered servers and set up the software. I used proxmox to create VMs and depoy basice kubernities pods. I also created a Rust/Rocket API that users could hit to automaticly create a MongoDB database and get a connection string back.

my Github username is CoderFeedForwardAlg
